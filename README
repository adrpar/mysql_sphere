This is a port of the pgSphere 1.1.1 library to MySQL. Ported are all spherical
functions but not the spherical index part.

Changes:
- made UDF calls coherent
- object wrapping is done using BLOBs that can either be base64 encoded or not
- due to non extensibility of MySQL SQL syntax, no operators are available for
  sphere objects and everything needs to be done using direct UDF function calls

No documentation is available yet, but this will be available in the future.

WARNING:
-------

This library is not yet tested and should be used at your own risk. Testing will
be added later, however since the code is (almost) a 1:1 copy of pgSphere 1.1.1
it should actually work...


To install
----------

1) Download the mysql source corresponding to your installed
   version. Building mysql from scratch is recommended.

   Note: ONLY MYSQL VERSION 5.5 AND ABOVE ARE CURRENTLY 
   	 SUPPORTED

2) edit CMakeList.txt accordingly to point to the directory 
   where mysql is installed.

3) edit CMakeList.txt accordingly to point to the directory
   of the mysql sources

4) mkdir build
   cd build

5) cmake ..

6) make

7) make install

8) log into mysql server as root and execute the commands in 
   install_udfs.sql

   This will setup the neccessary tables, install the plugin
   and create all the UDFs needed to administer the queue.
